            <h3>The Main Continent Kala</h3>
            <p id="head">
            Kala is the main Continent in the Southern hemisphere.  Once you get past 
            the Tamin mountains the weather is significantly colder.  However, the Northern 
            coast is still fairly warm and is the beggining of the Eastern bound 
            trade route.  Below is some general information about the coastal countries that you are 
            closest to.
        </p>

                        <p  id="GenCon" class="indent">Before there were numerous countries on the continent of Kala there 
                            were two Great Lands called Halcinia (West) and Selador 
                            (East). Halcinia was considered mostly uninhabitable, except 
                            by certain races of dwarves, elves, and gnomes who lived on the edge 
                            of the land and in the mountains. Therefore many clans of all races 
                            migrated to Selador to join those already there.  As the population of 
                            Selador grew so did its need for trade, solid borders, and organized government.  
                            Hence, there was a decision to split Selador between the clans creating the many 
                            countries we see today.

                        <p  id="GenCon2" class="indent">Obviously there have been border disputes, leading to 
                            growth and shrinkage between the lands.  For example the country of Tan has quadrupled in size 
                            since its birth.  As roadways were developed between countries, the clans began 
                            to become more intermingled with each other, creating more diverse countries hundreds
                            of years later best seen within the coastal countries.  The lands of Halcinia split 
                            as well, but are generally less populated and the borders are far more strict.  
                            The Halcin tundra was named in honor of the landâ€™s name before it split. 
                            For the most part the clans of Halcinia have stayed where they are and will 
                            continue to.  The only country originally part of Halcinia to go through a great
                            change is Edani which belonged to an ancient elven tribe.  For more info on this

                            The three dieties represent a balanced community as Tempus is the diety 
                            of wisdom, Torm is the diety of selflessness, and Tyr is the diety of
                            justice.  Their symbol is simple golden balanced scales surrounded by three 
                            stars.  The mother of the three, Eldath the Godess of Creation, is said to 
                            have created Hune as a place for her children to care for and teach them dicipline.  
                            It is said that when the siblings were young dieties the world was in turmoil, 
                            but as they matured so did the civilizations living on Hune.  The followers of this 
                            religion beleive that when you die your spirit is consumed by the Three, feeding them
                            so that they can continue to serve the world and keep it balanced.

                            She is depicted as a wise old cyclops woman on a blood red thrown.
                            In her right hand she holds the power of destruction and in her left creation.
                            She is an advocator for war and power but also for healing and building community.
                            Her symbol is coin, with a hand on each side.
                            The churches of ancalism are known for their kindness to the community and 
                            giving passerbys a place to stay.  This religion is also known for its belief in reincarnation
                            in the sense that a spirit lives on forever, passed through many beings.  In this way there 
                            is no such thing as true creation or destruction, making death just a transition into rebirth.
                            The followers of Ancalism feel they are not impeded by fear of destruction because it is just 
                            one part of Oghra's Cycle.

                            This religion is a Henotheism, which is when there is only "One God" without 
                            denying the existence of other minor dieties.  Ithir is the God of this religion,
                            but he has many "Disciples" or dieties who follow him, hundreds in fact.  They all 
                            have a purpose to serve within the lands of Agaanhaim, which is similar to the idea
                            of Heaven and is said to be a complex civilization ruled by Ithir. It is important
                            to know that there is no Hell in this religion, you either get a place in Agaanhaim or
                            not and your spirit is lost.  The beleivers of this religion were most comonly elvish
                            but currently it has many followers of all races around the world.  This is mostly due 
                            to how easy it is to convert followers because of its lax rules surrounding worship and 
                            how it adopts smaller dieties into its family of Disciples.  This has lead to Ithir and 
                            his Diciples being one of the furthest reaching religions.  So while it may not be as 
                            popular as other religions on the continent, it is well known world wide.
